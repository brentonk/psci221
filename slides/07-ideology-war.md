# Recap: What Do States Want?

1. To stay secure in their current position.
2. To expand their power in the international system.
3. To keep the current leadership in power.

* Territory: hard (land is zero-sum)
* Ideology: nearly impossible? (indivisibility)

# Day 1

* Re-orientation (where we're going, where we've been)
* Go through some empirical results from Bennett & Stam and Reiter & Stam
* Why would it be worth fighting a war over another state's form of government?
    * Go through the three models of "what states want"


# Day 2

* Use evidence from the French Revolutionary Wars to answer Day 1's question
    * How the Revolution threatened domestic regimes
    * And how it raised the French's military power, and future bargaining power
