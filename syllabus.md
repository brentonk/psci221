# Description

War is awful.  In the 20th century alone, war killed at least 136 million people.[^leitenberg]  What is the point of all this destruction?  It may seem naïve to ask, "Can't we all just get along?"  So we will ask a slightly different question: "Why can't we make a deal?"  Even if states don't like each other, wouldn't they be better off negotiating than fighting?

In this course, we will treat war as the consequence of bargaining failure.  War happens when states cannot reach negotiated settlements.  From this perspective, "What causes war?" constitutes two questions:

  1. What brings states to the negotiating table?

  2. Why do their negotiations fail?

We will try to answer these questions as social scientists would.  We will develop logically coherent theories of war, and we will use empirical evidence to evaluate those theories.  What we find may not be palatable to those who want to study war in order to end it.  We will see that there is no single definitive cause of war---and that many of the causes would be hard to eradicate.

# Grading

Your grade in PSCI 221 will be based on:

* **Critical Response Papers (30%).**  You will write three critical response papers, no more than four pages each,[^page-lengths] throughout the semester.  In each paper, you will choose a course reading of particular interest to you and make a critical argument about its central claims.  For more details, see the handout on critical response papers.

* **Class Presentation (10%).**  You will give a 15-minute presentation in class about one of the supplemental readings.  The schedule of presentations will be set in the second week of class.  For more details, see the handout on presentations.

* **Midterm Exam (30%).**  An in-class midterm consisting of short essay questions will be held on February 17.  *If you cannot be present in class on February 17, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can make alternative arrangements.*

* **Final Exam (30%).**  The final exam will be held at the time designated by the university, April 30 at 9:00 a.m.

Both exams will be open-book and open-notes, but electronic devices will not be allowed.  Accordingly, you may want to buy hard copies of the required books instead of e-books.

[^page-lengths]: Page lengths quoted assume a double-spaced document with 12-point text and 1-inch margins.


# Academic Integrity

As in all courses at Vanderbilt, your work in PSCI 221 is governed by the Honor Code.  I encourage you to discuss course material and assignments with your peers, but the written work you turn in must be solely your own.

I have no tolerance for plagiarism.  If you turn in plagiarized work, you will receive a failing grade for the course and be reported to the Honor Council.  Plagiarism is not just verbatim copying and pasting---representing someone else's ideas as your own without citing the source is also a form of plagiarism.  Ignorance of what constitutes plagiarism is not an excuse or a defense.  For more information about what is and is not plagiarism, refer to [the Student Handbook section on the Honor System](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/), particularly the section "The Honor Code Applied to Preparation of Papers."  Always remember: *when in doubt, cite.*
