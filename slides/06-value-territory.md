## How
# [fit] Territory
## gives states what they want

---

# The Sovereign State
## (a quick review)

A state has *sovereignty* in a piece of territory if it has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force there.

* Professional army
* Regular tax revenue
* Bureaucracy

# Bargaining and Territory

How—and when—is territory a cause of war?

We must know what makes it worth bargaining over.

^ We know that territorial changes necessarily involve war, but we don't know why states are bargaining over it in the first place

^ More valuable territory should be more war-prone

---

# What Do States Want?

1. To stay secure in their current position.
2. To expand their power in the international system.
3. To keep the current leadership in power.

^ To determine value of territory, need to judge it by states' goals

^ #3 involves viewing the state as the expression of its leadership

---

# Territory and Security

How does more territory aid security?

* Buffer for the center/capital
* Economic extraction

^ Extraction serves the military and the tax base

---

# Territory and Power

Why would a power-seeking state want more territory?

* Tautological?
* Bargaining power and salami tactics

---

# Territory and Domestic Politics

How does territory help a leader remain in power?

* Extraction and bribes
* Counter population pressures

^ Leaders worry about noble revolt and mass uprising

---

# The Science of Territorial Conflict

* Make assumptions about what states want
* Derive conclusions about most likely sources of territorial conflict
* Compare to historical record

^ We don't know what states want

^ What would the Russian takeover of Crimea support?

## The hidden (and not-so-hidden)
# [fit] Costs
## of territorial expansion

---

# Is Territory a Zero-Sum Game?

There's only so much territory in the world.

Whatever I have, you don't, and vice versa.

---

# Territorial *Stability* as Public Good

Simmons (2005) argues that all states benefit from stable boundaries.

* Better-defined property rights
* Less uncertainty
* Lower transaction costs

^ Assumption is essentially that sovereignty is better than not

^ Should be willing to give up *some* territory for sake of stability

---

# Drawing Boundaries

Carter and Goemans (2011) look at what kinds of new borders are typically drawn.

* Ethnic group cohesion?  No.
* Defensible borders?  No.
* Previous administrative frontiers?  Yes.

^ Does this support Simmons's argument?

^ Remind: Crucial implication here is that it might be mutually beneficial to take a little less

# Natural Resources

If economic extraction is a purpose of expansion, territory with natural resources should be especially valuable—right?

---

# Resource Curses

**Economic:** Countries with more natural resources tend to grow at slower rates.

**Political:** Countries with more natural resources are more likely to experience civil wars. 

---

# Costs of Governance

It can be costly to establish sovereignty in and extract economic resources from a new piece of territory. 

---

# Risk Factors for Costly Governance

* Heterogeneity and internal conflict
* New competitors for central authority
* Nationalism and the erosion of legitimacy

^ Notice that both heterogeneity and homogeneity can raise costs

---

# For Next Time

* Read Howard, ch. 5.
* Student presentations on "Powerful Pacifists" and "From Dynastic to National War."
