# Recap: Commitment Problems as a Cause of War

1. I must rather renege than abide by the settlement
2. You must rather fight now than let me get away with it
    * Cost of reneging can't be "priced into" settlement

---

# A Stark Example

* States A and B
* Territory at stake
    * Until war occurs: negotiated daily
    * After war: winner gets it forever
* Shifting power
    * Today: A sure to win
    * Tomorrow (and ever after): B sure to win

---

# A Stark Example

Suppose A and B reach some agreement for today.  What happens tomorrow?

* War
    * B gets everything, pays war cost
    * A gets nothing, pays war cost
* Bargaining table
    * B can offer A nothing
    * A will accept to avoid war costs

---

# A Stark Example

So what happens today?

* War
    * A gets everything, pays war cost
    * B gets nothing, pays war cost
* Bargaining table
    * A can take it all today
    * ... but will never get anything again

---

# A Stark Example

A's choice today:

* Attack → Have territory forever, pay war cost
* Negotiate → Have territory for a day, no war cost

How can B keep A from attacking?

^ Why wouldn't war occur if no commitment problem?

^ If B could sign a contract to give A some portion of the territory in the future, could assure it enough to make fighting not worthwhile

---

# Mitigating Factors

* Short-sightedness
* Less drastic power shift
* War destroys territory's value
* Power shift occurs regardless of war

---

# Powell's Conditions for Bargaining Breakdown

1. Dividing a flow of benefits
2. Cannot commit to future divisions
3. Each actor can lock in a division now
4. Locking in is inefficient
5. Shifts in power to lock in

^ Go through each of these, why they're present in the previous example, and why they matter for bargaining breakdown

^ on #4: if not inefficient, then we wouldn't care about breakdown (or it wouldn't be puzzling)

---

# The Logic

* No commitment → must compensate "up front"
* Small pool of benefits available at any given time
* Potentially huge gains to locking in via war
* Not enough available now to satisfy aggressor

---

# Shifting Power: The Puzzle

Why do states bother trying to gain power?

^ Or: under what conditions is it safe to do so?

---

# Other Examples

* First-strike advantages
* Bargaining over objects of future bargaining power

^ First-strike advantages:
* Is it true that power shifts over time?
* Doesn't the story have more to do with uncertainty?

^ Objects of future power:
* Salami tactics
* Interestingly, not necessarily leads to war
* Why different than exogenous power shift?  Because state can limit the extent to which it gains power, enough to give the other no incentive to fight

---

# Commitment Problems versus Uncertainty

* Limits of uncertainty as an explanation
    * Long wars
    * "If only we'd known..."
* Can uncertainty play a role in commitment problems?
* Implications for empirical study?

^ "If only": Talk about counterfactuals and interpretations of uncertainty as a cause of war

# For Next Time

* Second critical response paper is due
* Read Fearon, "Signaling Foreign Policy Interests" (JSTOR)
* Presentation on "Known Unknowns: Power Shifts, Uncertainty, and War"
* Presentation on "Does Private Information Lead to Delay or War in Crisis Bargaining?"
