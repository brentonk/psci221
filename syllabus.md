# Description

War is awful.  In the 20th century alone, war killed at least 136 million people.[^leitenberg]  Our goal in this course is to better understand the political processes that lead to all this destruction.  We will try to rationalize war.

I have organized the course around a line of argument---my scholarly take on the nature and origins of war.  If you come away from the course remembering only three things, let it be these.

1. War is a political act---an act of policy carried out by the government of a state.

2. To understand what wars are fought over, we must understand the nature and reason of the state.

3. To understand why states do not resolve these issues peacefully, we must understand why bargaining fails.

I don't claim that this is the final word on the causes of war.  As we will see, even scholars who work within these premises disagree plenty about specific causes of war.  And not all scholars accept these premises---nor should you, at least not without questioning them first.

[^leitenberg]: Milton Leitenberg, ["Deaths in Wars and Conflicts in the 20th Century"](http://pacs.einaudi.cornell.edu/system/files/Deaths-Wars-Conflicts3rd-ed.pdf) (Occasional Paper 29, Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies, Cornell University, 2006).


# Grading

Your grade in PSCI 2221 will be based on:

* **Critical Response Papers (25%).**  You will write two critical response papers, no more than five pages each,[^page-lengths] throughout the semester.  (An optional third paper may replace the lowest grade on the first two.)  In each paper, you will choose a course reading (required or supplemental) of particular interest to you and make a critical argument about its central claims.  For more details, see the handout on critical response papers.

* **Midterm Exam (15%).**  We will have an in-class midterm consisting of short essay questions on October 7.  *If you cannot be in class on October 7, please let me know as soon as possible so we can make alternative arrangements.*

* **Final Paper (50%).**  The bulk of your grade is based on a research paper.  In your final paper, you will make an original argument about the causes of war, backed by evidence from the historical record.  You should be thinking about potential paper topics all semester long.  As we proceed through the schedule of readings, take time to think about which of the research questions we encounter interest you the most.

    There are three parts to the final paper:

    * *Proposal (5%).*  You will write a 1--2 page proposal summarizing (1) your research question and (2) the body of evidence you will consult to back your argument.  I will not accept your final paper submission unless you have submitted a proposal and I have approved it.  The proposal itself is not graded, but 5% of your grade comes from turning it (and any subsequent revisions requested) in on time.  Proposals are due October 31.

    * *Presentation (10%).*  In the penultimate week of class, each student will deliver a brief (5--10 minute) presentation in class about his or her research design and preliminary findings.

    * *Paper (35%).*  The paper itself should be about 15 pages long and cannot exceed 20 pages (not including bibliography).  It is due at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, December 16.  Late papers will not be accepted.

* **Participation (10%).**  This class is a seminar, and your participation is crucial for its success. I expect you not only to attend class, but also to have completed the readings and prepared to discuss them.  Your attendance, preparation, and engagement in class discussion will all be reflected in your participation grade.

[^page-lengths]: Page lengths quoted assume a double-spaced document with 12-point text and 1-inch margins.


# Academic Integrity

As in all courses at Vanderbilt, your work in PSCI 2221 is governed by the Honor Code.  I encourage you to discuss course material and assignments with your peers, but the written work you turn in must be solely your own.

I have no tolerance for plagiarism.  If you turn in plagiarized work, you will receive a failing grade for the course and be reported to the Honor Council.  Plagiarism is not just verbatim copying and pasting---representing someone else's ideas as your own without citing the source is also a form of plagiarism.  Ignorance of what constitutes plagiarism is not an excuse or a defense.  For more information about what is and is not plagiarism, refer to [the Student Handbook section on the Honor System](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/), particularly the section "The Honor Code Applied to Preparation of Papers."  Always remember: *when in doubt, cite.*
