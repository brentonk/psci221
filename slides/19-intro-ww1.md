# How to Read History

* Read actively
* Take notes
* Focus on big picture

^ Focus on details doesn't mean ignore details, but rather consider what they reveal about broader trends and arguments

---

# World War I: Why We Care

* How it began
* How it proceeded
* How it ended

^ How it proceeded:
* Brutal trench warfare
* 10 million KIA
* connect to costs of war

^ How it ended:
* Massive internal political changes (ending of empires, formation of republics)
* ...but those changes had limited consequences for international politics
* connect to inefficiency puzzle

# Two Perspectives

* War as inevitable
    * Irreconcilable conflicts among major powers
    * Why did it happen when it did?
* War as contingent
    * Sarajevo as more than pretext
    * Why did it spiral into a world war?

^ Connect the inevitability view to balance of power theorists?

^ On the contingency point: there's nothing in the first two chapters of Clark that makes you say "...and, therefore, 10 million soldiers died"

^ Really we need to answer *both* questions—why the Balkan crisis was sparked, and why it became so much more
