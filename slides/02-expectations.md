# Your
# [fit] Questions
# for me

---

# Is this course more historical with regard to assessments—i.e., will tests be more history-based or analytical?

---

# How will this class shape my view on war?

---

## If the exams are open-note, what will we be tested on beyond the notes and resources available?<br/><br/><br/>What are the formats of the midterm and final?

---

# What is your background/interest in war?

---

# [fit] Power
# and the outbreak of war

---

# An Old Question

How does the balance of power affect the risk of war?

* Is war more likely between evenly matched states?
* Or do the strong prey on the weak?

---

# Blainey's Answer

"Wars usually end when the fighting nations *agree* on their relative strength, and wars usually begin when fighting nations *disagree* on their relative strength" (p. 122).

---

# At the End of a War

Is power more balanced than at the start?

Do the combatants agree more about their relative power?

---

# Disagreement about Relative Power

Why would states disagree about their relative power in the first place?

And why does war help resolve that disagreement?

---

# Two Puzzles

Do we have to have a war to get states to agree?

Why won't states fight if they do agree?

---

# Principles of
# [fit] Bargaining

---

# Fearon's Generalization of Blainey

Wars start when states cannot reach a settlement by bargaining.

(Disagreement about relative strength is one obstacle to bargaining.)

---

# Bargaining: A Simple Example

You and a friend are debating about restaurants.

If you don't agree, you'll both eat at home.

Your friend is an excellent cook.  You can barely heat up a Hot Pocket.

Who's more likely to get their way?

---

# Bargaining Power

The less you'd suffer from failing to agree, the more bargaining power you hold.

---

# A General Bargaining Model

* Two or more actors
* Valuable object at stake
* Settlement outcome
    * Division of the object among the actors
    * All must agree to the settlement
* Disagreement outcome
    * If a settlement isn't reached
    * Each actor gets their *reservation value*

---

# Bargaining and War

* Actors: States
* Object: Policy or Political Aim
    * Commerce
    * Territory
    * Ideology
    * Identity
* Settlement: Negotiated Policy
* Disagreement: War

# Bargaining Power in War

A state's reservation value is what it could expect to obtain in case of war.

Better capabilities
→ Better expected outcome
→ Higher reservation value
→ More bargaining power

^ Segue: How can we tell what a state's bargaining power is?

---

# The Gamble of War

> No other human activity is so continuously or universally bound up with chance.  And through the element of chance, guesswork and luck come to play a great part in war.
> --Clausewitz (p. 85)

Bargaining power depends not on what *will* happen in war, but on what states *expect* to happen.

^ Same goes for agreement about relative power

^ How would states form these expectations?

# Would You Play This Game?

I'll flip a coin.  If heads, I give you $50.  If tails, you give me $48.

---

# Risk Attitudes

**Risk neutral:** Sure thing ≈ Gamble

**Risk averse:** Sure thing > Gamble

**Risk loving:** Gamble > Sure thing

---

# For Next Time

* We'll finish discussing the bargaining model of war and see why it's puzzling that states may not be able to reach negotiated settlements.
* Read Fearon 1995, "Rationalist Explanations for War" (link on syllabus on course website, <http://bkenkel.com/psci221>).
* Be prepared to select supplemental readings to present on.
