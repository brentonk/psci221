# Let's Play a Game

* Two players each roll a dice
* Whoever rolls higher wins

---

# A More Interesting Version

1. Each player rolls and *privately* sees own roll
2. Each player simultaneously:
   * Chooses "play" or "don't play"
   * Reveals roll

Both "play" → pay small cost, play game

Either "don't play" → no cost, no play

---

Each round: 20 points at stake

Playing costs 1 point each.

* Don't play: +10 points each
* Play and win: +19 points
* Play and lose: –1 point
* Play and tie: +9 points each
