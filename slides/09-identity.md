# Identity

We think of *identity* as personal characteristics that are impossible, or exceedingly difficult, to change.

---

# Identity

* Immutable (or nearly so)
    * Race
    * Ethnicity
    * Religion
    * Gender identity and sexual orientiation
* Not immutable
    * Ideology
    * Economic class

# Can Identity Alone Cause War?

Recall our conceptions of war.

* Clausewitz 1: "An act of force to compel our enemy to do our will."
* Clausewitz 2: "The continuation of policy by other means."
* Bargaining model: Use of force when negotiations fail.

^ Bargaining involves the division of some good, changing the status quo

^ But identity can't be changed or divided, by definition

^ So a disagreement over identity alone amounts to a desire for removal

# Can Identity Alone Cause War?

Hatred on the basis of identity can cause *violence* on a horrific scale, but not *war* in the way we have defined it.

---

# Nationalism

An ideology whereby one's attachment to a state forms a component of one's identity.

The state, in turn, becomes the political representative of the nation.

^ Connect to French Revolution

# Nationalism and Territory

* State sovereignty is defined territorially
* State is the political manifestation of the nation

$$\Downarrow$$

* State and national boundaries must coincide

# Nationalism and War in European Politics

* Italian unification (1848–1866)
* German unification (1864–1871)
* Decolonization (1776–1975)
* World War I? (1914–1918)
* World War II (1939–1945)
* Wars in Bosnia (1992–1995) and Kosovo (1998–1999)

# Summary

* Identity alone doesn't cause war
* But identity channeled through (or stoked by) the *ideology* of nationalism can cause *territorial* war

---
