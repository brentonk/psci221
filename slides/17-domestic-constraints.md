# Recap: Causes of Bargaining Breakdown

* Uncertainty
* Commitment problems
* Mobilization

---

# Domestic Politics and Bargaining Breakdown

* How can domestic politics cause war?
* Do democracies or dictatorships have more bargaining power?

^ To answer, need a theory of relationship between domestic politics and international negotiations

---

# International Negotiations as Two-Level Game

1. Governments bargain with each other
2. Domestic audiences "ratify" the deal
    * Everyone ratifies → Agreement implemented
    * Anyone doesn't → Disagreement outcome

^ Leaders are forward-looking → deal in first stage depends on what can get done in second

---

# Two-Level Games and War

The two-level game is a *general* theory of international negotiations.

Let's apply it to bargaining in the shadow of war.

# Bargaining Outcomes

Effects of strengthening the domestic constraint:

1. More favorable settlement *if* a deal is reached
2. Less chance of reaching a deal

# Domestic Constraints: Share of Spoils

Tighter domestic constraint → Greater share

# Domestic Constraints: Risk of War

Tighter domestic constraint → War more likely

# Two-Level Games and War
## Problems: The Cost of War

Isn't war more costly for the public?

^ No effect of marginal shift in win set size

# Two-Level Games and War
## Problems: Democratic Peace

War is relatively unlikely between democracies.

Wouldn't this theory imply the opposite?

^ Next time: we'll see a model that incorporates the same risk-reward tradeoff, but is consistent with the democratic peace

---

# Conclusions

* Cross-cutting effects of domestic constraints
    * Settlements less likely
    * Better outcomes if settlement is reached
* Application to bargaining in the shadow of war: shaky at best

---

# For Next Time

* Read Fearon, "Domestic Political Audiences and the Escalation of International Disputes" (JSTOR)
* Start reading *The Sleepwalkers*?
* Presentation on "Domestic Opposition and Signaling in International Crises"
* Presentation on "Autocratic Audience Costs"
